# Liver-Cirrhosis-Prediction-using-Random-Forest-
The Liver Cirrhosis Prediction using Random Forest project is developed using Python and deployed as an interactive Streamlit web application. It aims to help in the early prediction of liver diseases, especially cirrhosis, by analyzing patient health data. The project is structured into two main modules, Home and Prediction. The Home module provides a clear overview of the project, explaining its objectives, significance, and workflow. It also allows users to upload and view the CSV dataset, which contains various medical attributes such as age, bilirubin levels, enzyme activities, and protein ratios. The data undergoes preprocessing to handle missing values and improve model efficiency. The Prediction module enables users to input patient details manually, and upon submission, the system predicts whether the patient is likely to have liver cirrhosis. The prediction is powered by a Random Forest Classifier, an ensemble learning algorithm that combines multiple decision trees to ensure high accuracy and robustness. The model achieves an impressive 90% accuracy, making it reliable for clinical analysis. Additionally, the project includes seven types of visualizations, which help in understanding data patterns and feature relationships, such as distributions, correlations, and class comparisons. These visual insights enhance interpretability and aid in data-driven decision-making. Overall, this Streamlit-based web app demonstrates how machine learning can be effectively integrated into healthcare analytics for timely diagnosis and better patient outcomes.
